# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
PyBer has asked me to analyze their ride-sharing data in order to improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.


## Results
### City Types
There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.


I have reshaped the Pyber data to show the sum of teh fares made in each city type each week from 1/1/19 to 4/29/19


## Summary
There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
